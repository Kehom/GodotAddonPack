# This is the "main" game scene of the "MegaDemo", which is basically a demo
# showcasing every relevant addon combined. This is meant to be used as a
# way to show addons in a "real case use" rather than the focused demos
# that are meant to be used as simplistic examples of specific addons.
#
# Things to note in this demo:
# - The network addon is used to perform synchronization using snapshots.
#   This addon requires activation in the project settings window
# - The smooth addon (Smooth3D) is used to perform interpolation of the
#   visual representation of the various game objects. Enabling this addon
#   in the project settings window brings the smooth nodes to the node
#   selection window.

# TODO:
# - Use the network chat system
# - Use the entered name in the main menu
# - Include environment (time of day and maybe weather)
# - Add (simple) pickups (to showcase the network event system)
